scikit-cuda
===========
scikit-cuda provides Python interfaces to many of the functions in the
CUDA device/runtime, CUBLAS, CUFFT, and CUSOLVER libraries distributed
as part of NVIDIA's `CUDA Programming Toolkit
<http://www.nvidia.com/cuda/>`_, as well as interfaces to select
functions in the `CULA Dense Toolkit
<http://www.culatools.com/dense>`_.  Both low-level wrapper functions
similar to their C counterparts and high-level functions comparable to
those in `NumPy and Scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ are provided.

Python wrappers for cuDNN by Hannes Bretschneider are available `here
<https://github.com/hannes-brt/cudnn-python-wrappers>`_.
