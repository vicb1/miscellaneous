# Udacity-Transcript-Formatter
A simple script that allows users to process Udacity's transcript .zip archives into a more readable format.

This was created using Python 3.4 and a rudimentary knowledge of Python's zipfile library.  It is entirely possible that things were used incorrectly in this code.  It was created with the primary intention of personal use, but shared knowing that others might find it to be useful.  The code isn't as perfect as it could be, but it is currently functional.

It is very possible that some of the transcripts generated by Udacity will not work perfectly with this script, resulting in bad output.

The excerpted subtitles included with the example were generated by Udacity.  The videos can be found here https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs101/l-48299949/m-48698544.  

I have included an example (non-archived) .srt file for comparison with the processed results found in /parsedTranscripts.
