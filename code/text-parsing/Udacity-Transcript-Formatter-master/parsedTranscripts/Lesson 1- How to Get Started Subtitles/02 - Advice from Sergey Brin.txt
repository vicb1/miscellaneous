Lets get started by asking Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, what the most important thing is in building 
a search engine. So what's your take on how to build a search engine? You have built one before, right? 
Yes, I think the most important thing if you want to build a search engine, I think is to have a really 
good, fun corpus to start with. In our case we used the world wide web which at the time was significantly 
smaller than it is today. It was also very new and exciting there were all kinds of unexpected things there.
