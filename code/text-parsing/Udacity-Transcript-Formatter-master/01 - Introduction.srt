00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,896
Welcome to CS101. I'm Dave Evans, I will be your guide on this journey.

2
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:06,745
This course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas  in computing

3
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:09,579
and teach you to read and write your own computer programs.

4
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:12,763
We are going to do that in the context of building a web search engine.

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:16,362
I'm guessing everyone here has at least used a search engine before.

6
00:00:16,362 --> 00:00:20,714
Like Google, DuckDuckGo or even my personal favorite - DaveDaveFind.

7
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:23,631
You type in what you are looking for, and voila -

8
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:28,379
in literally a blink of an eye, about a tenth of a second, back come the results.

9
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,695
This might not be enough to make you wise, but it is pretty amazing.

10
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:36,196
A goal of this class is to turn some of the magic of the search engine

11
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:38,196
into something a bit more understandable.

12
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:41,196
Our biggest goal tho is to learn about computer science.

13
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:43,345
Computer science is about how to solve problems,

14
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:44,997
like building a search engine,

15
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:46,896
by breaking them into smaller pieces

16
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:51,945
and then precisely and mechanically describing a sequence of steps that you can use to solve each piece.

17
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:54,863
And those steps can be executed by a computer.

18
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:57,162
For our search engine the three main pieces are:

19
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:59,229
finding data by crawling web pages,

20
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,445
building an index to be able to respond quickly to search queries,

21
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:06,512
and ranking pages so that we get the best result for a given query.

22
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:08,562
In this course we will not get into everything that you need

23
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:10,762
to build a search engine as powerful as Google,

24
00:01:10,762 --> 00:01:14,996
but we will cover the main ideas and learn a lot about computer science along the way.

25
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:17,779
The first three units will focus on building the web crawler.

26
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:19,529
We will talk more about that soon.

27
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:22,846
Units 4 and 5 will cover how to respond to queries quickly.

28
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:25,213
And unit 6 will get into how to rank results

29
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:29,046
and cover the method Google uses to rank pages, that made it so successful.

30
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:31,492
But first, let's talk about how to build a web crawler

31
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:35,000
that we are going to use to get data for our search engine.
