#---------- tidy data for regular season totals ----------#

# First I will define a function that will take the detailed results data and reshape it so that it results in a dataframe where 
# each observation is a team for that season and their totals statistics for that season. It will also calculate the statistics allowed
# for the season. This function only requires one parameter to be passed to it: either the regular season or Tourney detailed data.

# IMPORTANT: #
# The data required for this function to work is either the regular season or tourney detailed stats, and the "teams" dataset
